Just stepped out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Life List, and I'm honestly all over the place with this one. It’s like, I don’t know whether to love it or want to throw my popcorn at the screen. Imagine if a geology lecture and a soap opera had a bizarre love child — that’s this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, in a nutshell.

First off, what was even going on with the characters? One minute they're all deep in philosophical debates, the next, they're knee-deep in in a glittering crystal cave like something out of a Hollywood fever dream. I mean, I get it, drama needs a bit of sparkle, but come on. Also, did anyone really buy that super intense monologue about rocks and life purpose? I love geology but even I was like, chill, dude.

> Honestly, who knew a   could make you feel both inspired and kind of irritated? The cinematography was something, though. The way they captured the landscapes — those lava flows made my geology-loving heart skip a beat. But then they’d throw in a random, sappy dialogue and I’d roll my eyes so hard, I'm surprised I didn't get dizzy. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it is like trying to finish a jigsaw puzzle and realizing you're missing, like, 12 pieces.

I’ve got to say, though, that one character, the guy who couldn't stop talking about strata — yeah, him. Reminded me of my college days, scribbling down notes while half-asleep in my Geology 101 class. There’s something comforting in that, a little nostalgic flashback that I didn’t see coming. It's weird how this   brings out the nostalgia even as it kind of annoys you.

    purpose = undefined
    for rock in rocks:
        purpose = reflect
    return purpose

The music was, well, interesting. That song playing during the sweeping landscape scenes... fittingly dramatic or just trying too hard? I can't decide. Maybe it’s a sign I should just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and give it another go, see if I missed something — like a standout memorable scene that didn't involve a dramatic pause. Or maybe not. Not sure I have the patience to sit through it another time.

So yeah, if you happen to be strangely curious about a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that feels like a rollercoaster of geology and overdramatic life questions, check out The Life List. It’s... an experience. Kind of like finding a cool rock that’s shiny on one side and, well, just a rock on the other. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 at your own risk, dear friends.
